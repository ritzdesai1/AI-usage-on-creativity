# Impact of AI Usage on Human Creativity
This is an ongoing project that aims to research the effect of the usage of AI tools such as ChatGPT on human artistic creativity.  While tools such as ChatGPT, Bard, StarryAI, DALL-E 2, etc. have revolutionized how we create new art, one might wonder if this threatens the basic human ability to think divergently. If everyone depends on AI to generate new ideas, then many of them may be like recycled versions of one another. It may create an artistic draught and hold the potential to make humans lazier. 
Two surveys were conducted for this research to study the correlation and causation between the two variables of AI usage and creativity. Correlational and Experimental research designs are employed for this project. For correlational analysis, it is hypothesized that people who score higher on the AI usage scale will score lower on the creativity scale. For experimental analysis, the independent variable of AI usage is manipulated by asking the experimental group of participants to write a poem using ChatGPT and the control group of participants to write a poem on their own. Creativity was measured using the Kaufman Domains of Creativity Scale (K-DOCS). It was hypothesized that people in the experimental group would score lower on the K-DOCS.
